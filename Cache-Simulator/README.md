We will give .txt file which contains the test cases.
The file contains a trace of memory accesses executed from some benchmark program.   
The 1st line specifies the cache size. 
The 2nd line specifies the block size. 
The 3rd line specifies the associativity. 0 represents direct-mapped, 1 represents four-way set associative, 2 represents fully associative
The 4th line specifies the Replace algorithm. 0 represents FIFO, 1 represents LRU. 
The rest of the test case is a trace of memory accesses executed from some benchmark program.
